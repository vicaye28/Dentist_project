# Dentist office
A SQL project to practice scripting 

## Introduction 
I have opened a new dental practice and I am eager to get my affairs in order.
Lucky for me, I have some loyal patients and have managed to get 3 dentists employed at my practice.

### Tasks
* Create and normalise a schema to reduce data redundancy.
* Populate the tables using INSERT or a .csv file import 
* Create a function to add age status to each patient-follow on to see if they qualify for free care
* Create procedures to add new patients to the practice including allocating them to a dentist. 

## Takeaways
This project brought together a lot of what I have learned on my journey with SQL.
It was very challenging but fun to try and come up with the syntax to achieve my goals.
